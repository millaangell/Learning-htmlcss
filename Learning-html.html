  <h3>This is for testing out and tracking my changes while in the learning process of HTML and stuff </h3>
    <P> There will be a list of the goals I want to reach, and once I reach those, I am going to set up more goals(wow). </p>
     <p> I am going to keep track of my progress and what issues I am having/working on. AKA to-do list.
      <br /> I am also going to make a small list of ideas I want to learn how to do. AKA a to-learn list.
